Hi, this is Yash Ghatge. I am from Maharashtra, India.  I have done my UG in Electronics and Communication Engineering and was introduced to some computer  course like C, C++. I have done projects on Arduino using Embedded C language in my undergrad.  My final project was HUMAN FALL DETECTION. A wearable monitoring device which can accurately  distinguish falls from non-falls of elderly persons and by using existing proven  technologies (GPS, GSM/GPRS), alerts their caregivers. After graduating,  I have worked as Salesforce Developer for 2 years and was involved in multiple  projects which deals with coding and automation was used to build the custom solution  for clients like Mentee and Mentor management including activities, tasks, action plans  within Salesforce. Created various API to connect to a Mobile App to Salesforce etc..

# Course Objective for me
